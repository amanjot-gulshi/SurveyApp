# SurveyApp

Creating an app where users can create and fill out surveys. This is just a fun project I started to learn more about backend development using Django and using database models. I also wanted to work with API calls as well as using Redux for state management in a large application with several side-by-side components that would not be able to use props. Using Redux also allows for better structured code where it's easy for me to identify where issues are occuring.
